# Comparison of IRIS Native Globals API and EAV-approach in relational db (MySQL)

## About EAV-model
The EAV-model is designed to store hierarchical and sparse structures in relational databases.

The EAV-approach is widespread among programmers, but with the advent of IRIS Native API, is it worth using it further?

## My articles about EAV-model and IRIS globals

## Purpose of this project

Make a comparison of the performance approaches on the numbers.
I want to see how much time it takes to create thousands of products, as well as to access them using IRIS Native API and EAV (MySQL).

In the project, a data scheme is created the same as in real projects on IRIS globals and SQL for objective comparison.

Transactions are used in both approaches. Products are created in random sections of the catalog.

When testing the loading of product properties, random products are loaded to make it harder to use caching database techniques.

## Data model in project

The structure of the demo data that we will store:

![The structure of the demo data](https://community.intersystems.com/sites/default/files/inline/images/images/data_structure1.png)

Global for this structure created in beginning [schema.py](src/schema.py).

SQL schema [schema.sql](src/schema.sql).

## Original tools inside my project

I created a usefull library in Python [iglobal.py](src/iglobal.py) that allows you to work with globals in an object-oriented way.

```
node = good.node('index1', 'index2')

node.set(5)
node.inc(2)
i = node.iterator()

print(node.get())

good.kill()
```

You may initialize whole tree with one operation:

```
good = iGlobal('good')

good.init(
{'Storages':
     { 'id' : 1,
       'Properties':
        {'capacity':
           {'name': 'Capacity, GB',
            'sort': 100,
            'searchable': 1,
            'table_view': 1
           },
         'weight':
           {'name': 'Weight, kg',
            'sort': 800,
            'searchable': 1,
            'table_view': 1
           }
       },
      'SSD':
        {'id' : 2,
         'Properties':
          {'endurance':
            {'name': 'Endurance, TBW',
             'sort': 200,
             'searchable': 1,
             'table_view': 1
            }
          },
         'AIC PCI-E': {'id': 3},
         'SATA':      {'id': 4},
         'M.2':       {'id': 5}
      }
    }
  }
)
```

## Estimated container build time
First time running ~2-15 minutes. Depending on the speed of your internet.
After the 1st time running the next ones will perform better and take few seconds.

# Usage
## Build containers
```
docker-compose build
```

## Run containers
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Run application in browser

Go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/)

## Run application in command line

After starting containers open another terminal (under *root* user) and type commands:
```
docker ps
```
See IRIS container name (column NAMES)

```
# Go in IRIS container
docker exec -it IRIS_CONTAINER_NAME bash
# inside container
cd /app
python3 cmd.py
```

## Stop containers

```
docker-compose stop
```
